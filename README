The purpose of this project is to make PersonalBrain look at little nicer. Currently it provides:

* A new background for PersonalBrain
* A few replacement icons/buttons for the application itself

Note: This doesn't touch your data at all. If you mess up, worst case scenario is you have to download another copy of PersonalBrain and re-install it. Your database and everything else will still be there. If you're still nervous feel free to back it all up first.

To apply the changes, download the files and from a Terminal (in OS X) cd into the download directory and run the following command.

cp -Rf Resources/* /Applications/PersonalBrain.app/Contents/Resources/

This replaces the existing images with the new ones leaving everything else in place. On Windows I'm not sure how to do this, but if you are a Windows user and would like to send me instructions (or fork the project and write them yourself) I'd be happy to include them. Same for Linux.

TODO:
There are plenty of other icons and images that I haven't touched and I'd be happy for any help in making them nicer.

The license for any modifications I've made is Creative Commons attribution (you can do whatever you want with it if you give e some attribution if you change this or post it elsewhere. Really you don't have to even give me attribution but that'd be nice to do if you feel like it.)
